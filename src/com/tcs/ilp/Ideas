1. Need to check if user is already logged in the web site or not.

Solution:

Create a flag(0/1) in database.
Always set that flag as '1' whenever a user logs in.
Whenever a user logs in, check the flag value.
    if flag value is '1', ask the user to log in and log out the other session(log out to be done before log in.)
    if the flag value is '0', the user logs in normally.
    
Design:
When a user clicks on Log in.
check the flag value
